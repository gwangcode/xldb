# xldb
A platform to operate xlsx data in a terminal

This is a platform based on python to run commands and scripts mainly for manipulating data in xlsx files using openpyxl library.

Compositions:

  xldb.py is the platform command. You can type:

            ./xldb.py

  to start the platform's command environment.

  xldb.py relies on sys, os, glob, shlex, re, prompt_toolkit, traceback, fnmatch, io libraries.
  
  Paths.set is the setup file to designate Libraries directory, Script Directory, Initial imports, End-command and Autocomplete script. The file is written in the following form:

          LibDir=Libs
          ScriptDir=Scripts
          Imports=stdwb as wb, openpyxl as xl, multi
          EndCmd=EndCmd
          AutoComplete=AUTOCOMPLETE

In Paths.set:
  LibDir=@/Libs;
  ScriptDir=@/Scripts; # ; separate the directories that store the commands; After # is the comment, @ represents the Bin-Directory, the directory where xldb.py is
  Imports=stdwb as wb, openpyxl as xl, multi
  EndCmd=EndCmd
  AutoComplete=AUTOCOMPLETE

  LiDir designates the diretcotries of the import libraries, where @ represents the xldb.py directory; ';' separates paths; The comments are behind '#' 
  ScriptDir designates the command paths; ';' separate the directories that store the commands; After # is the comment, @ represents the xldb.py directory
  Imports: imports libraries at the initial
  EndCmd designates the command that runs after each command line is finished. It contains the prompt information.
  AutoComplete designates the autocomplete command that autocompletes the input



In command environment:

.ls : run shell command (3)

/a=$.abc: make the script environment (python environment), run python functions  (3)

=a: the variable a

abc && def : split two commands. The commands run one after another (1)

~a=abc : return value of command abc goes to variable a (2)

cmd abc def

cmd ‚Äú=`.cmd2 abc`‚Äù

@~/Documents/abc -> run command abc in the designated path

abc/def: designate the path of the command, this equals: .../Script/abc/def


In script environment:

$.abc or `.abc` : run command
$.abc:print =x or `üî§üî§:abc:print =x`: run command with external variable abc

In both environments:

abc; :do not print cprint=False

args ‚Üí parameters



          > A && B && C
          _GLB[‚Äòx‚Äô] in A can not be used in B and C


built-in functions & varibles:

args: command parameters
gvars(): global dict (similar to globals())
cmd(): run command
err(): error message
cprint(): print when set is on
prompt(): set up prompt text
initsys(): reload initsys() ‚Üí reinitialize system
setprint(): set print on/off
#rtn(): return value of each command, rtn() ‚Üí get the return value of the last command; 
#rtn(True)/rtn(CheckTunnel=True) ‚Üí get the return value of the last command when it‚Äôs on the tunnel command series, only when && exists,  like: cmd 1 && cmd 2 && cmd 3 ‚Ä¶, otherwise #rtn() returns None
builtins.py: import builtins to use all the above built-in functions in lib
_RTN ‚Üí return value of the previous command in cmd 1 && cmd 2 && cmd 3 ‚Ä¶
                _RTN in cmd 2 is the return value of cmd 1
     
      _GLB ‚Üí public variable dict that can store variables used as public variables from the top level cmd:
          A:  $. B
          B:  $. C
          C:  ‚Ä¶
          >A ‚Üí GLB[‚Äòx‚Äô] in A  can be used throughout A, B, C

Variables in a script:
In a script:
x=5
$. print(x) # directly use outside variables

$. ~y=10
print($~y) # use the inside variable

Pipe between commands & shell commands
.print abc && .|grep a
Output: abc
The shell accepts the strings printed out by cprint
